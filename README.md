I do random coding stuffs on my free time.

I can do some things on those languages:
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))
- [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
- [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker) (using Game Maker 8.1)
- [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language))

Tried to learn but gave up/not interested:
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) (C is enough)
- [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
- [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) (not comfortable with the syntax)
- [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocaml) (wasted 2 hours installing the toolchain because it forcing me to have msvc 2019 while i have msvc 2022)
- [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))

I also browse random github repos occasionally, finding random Windows customization and Blue Archive projects.
