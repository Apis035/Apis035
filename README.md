## Hello!

I love browsing random interesting open source projects on GitHub that related to programming languages, Blue Archive, and Windows customization.

I'm interested in programming languages that are compiled, easy to use, and fun to write. Mostly uses C and Lua. Currently learning [Odin](https://odin-lang.com). Other languages that I also interested in are [Pluto](https://pluto-lang.org) (what I think Lua is supposed to be) and [Adept](https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept) (compiled language without GC but feels like a dynamic language).

I have very little interest in things related to webdev, AI, and whatever else it is that are currently popular that seems like a bloated software.
