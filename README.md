## Hello!

I'm a person from Indonesia that loves browsing random interesting open source projects on GitHub that related to programming languages, Blue Archive stuffs, and Windows customization tools.

I'm mostly interested in programming languages that are compiled, easy to use, and fun to write. Mostly uses C and Lua. Currently learning [Odin](https://odin-lang.com). Other languages that I also interested in are [Pluto](https://pluto-lang.org) and [Adept](https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept).

I have no interest in things related to webdev, AI, and whatever else it is that are currently popular that seems like a bloated software.
