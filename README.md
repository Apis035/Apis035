## Hello!

I do random project related to osu!, Blue Archive, and small Windows programs.

Mostly write code in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and [Odin](https://odin-lang.com/).
Also looking into [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [Adept](https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept).

I have little to no skill in web development stuff.

## Environment

- OS: Windows 10
- Editor: Sublime Text
- Terminal: Command Prompt

Preferred to stay in Windows 8.1 if modern apps doesn't have issues running on it.
