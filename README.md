Hi, I do random stuffs on my free time.

Self taught myself to learn various programming languages and mastered none of them.

I can do some things on those languages:
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))
- [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
- [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker) (using Game Maker 8.1)
- [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language))
- [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin)

Tried to learn but gave up/not interested:
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) (C is enough)
- [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
- [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) (not comfortable with the syntax)
- [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocaml) (toolchain is pain to install)
- [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))

I can't do web programming: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Occasionally browsing random GitHub repos, finding Windows customization and Blue Archive projects.
